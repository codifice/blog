# Codifice Blog

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3fc53a50-e7b6-4516-ba10-f70a868790bb/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/codifice/deploys)

The initial Codifice.uk blog site, a new Hugo powered static site intended to promote myself as a flexible Full Stack Developer and to host my blog posts.

This will replace [MartinOnDotNet](http://martinondotnet.blogspot.com/) and will act as the public face of the Codifice Organisation which brings together most of my side projects under a single GitHub Organisation from a disperate of legacy GitHub accounts.

## The Blog
The blog itself is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) powered and hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with blog post comments being provided by [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es).  I've customised the [Minimo](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/) to suite my tastes and leveraged royalty free images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) for post thumbnails and cover images.

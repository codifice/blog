      <description>Thereâ€™s been a big deal made of a serious security flaw in ASP.Net which potentially affects a lot of .Net sites, that allows a 3rd Party to trick ASP.Net into serving sensitive files within a web application folder.&amp;nbsp; Microsoft have released official advise on how to temporarily patch the problem which revolves around forcing Error&amp;nbsp; and Page Not found pages to return the same status page.&amp;nbsp; This would need to stay in place until a permanent fix is released.</description>

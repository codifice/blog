      <description>There are times in any semi-advanced ASP.NET developers life when they’re working with databound templated controls (such as the Repeater) and they need to find a control without knowing where it is, or even if its there.
Normally, you’re reduced to using the standard FindControl method available on any control.&amp;nbsp; But this only finds controls with a given id within the same NamingContainer.&amp;nbsp; I’ve written some extension methods to try and get around the (many) issues that I’ve had with FindControl and hopefully people will find them useful.</description>

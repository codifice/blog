      <description>I’ve recently had to do a quick bit of DB performance analysis work on a 3rd Party database to see if I can improve performance(without being too invasive).&amp;nbsp; The quickest way to do this, is using the Database Tuning Engine Advisor tool that comes with SQL 2008 (the best way is to have loads of experience and a tonne of time to properly analyse the database). Part of my analysis procedure was to make a script of queries that I could run with and without the DTA recommended indexes to evaluate any real world improvement.</description>

      <description>I’ve recently needed to have a multilingual menu where the id for each menu item is the same across all languages, this is a bit of a tall order using the workarea as only the root menu item will share the id.
So I’ve knocked out a quick’n’dirty TSQL script to clone a menu across across several languages whilst maintaining the relevant ids.
1: BEGIN TRANSACTION  2:&amp;nbsp;   3: CREATE TABLE #NewMenu (  4: [mnu_id] [bigint] NOT NULL,  5: [mnu_name] [nvarchar](255) NULL,  6: [mnu_description] [nvarchar](255) NULL,  7: [folder_id] [bigint] NOT NULL,  8: [recursive] [int] NOT NULL,  9: [user_id] [bigint] NULL,  10: [date_created] [datetime] NOT NULL,  11: [last_edit_date] [datetime] NULL,  12: [last_edit_lname] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,  13: [last_edit_fname] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,  14: [mnu_type] [int] NOT NULL,  15: [mnu_link] [nvarchar](255) NULL,  16: [template_link] [nvarchar](255) NULL,  17: [parent_id] [bigint] NULL,  18: [ancestor_id] [bigint] NULL,  19: [content_language] [int] NOT NULL,  20: [mnu_image] [nvarchar](512) NULL,  21: [mnu_image_override] [int] NULL,  22: [mnu_to_folders] [nvarchar](512) NULL,  23: [mnu_to_templates] [nvarchar](255) NULL,  24: [dynamic_replication_method] [int] NULL)  25: GO  26:&amp;nbsp;   27: WITH MenuCTE AS (  28: SELECT *  29: FROM [dbo].</description>

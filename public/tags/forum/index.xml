      <description>Yesterday went well and I’ve now got the basic N2CMS install working and the Forum Addon has been installed, so my objectives for today are:
 Day 2 – N2CMS Configuration  Integrate the Membership Provider from n2cms/forum/legacy vwt2oc  Construct basic site structure (homepage/articles/forum/gallery/events calendar/etc)  Create VWT2OC basic theme     Integrating the Membership Provider One of the first tasks I need to undertake is integrating the underlying security model.</description>

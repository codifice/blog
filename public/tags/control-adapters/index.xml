      <description>I was recently put in a difficult position when I was attempting to integrate some of our reliable, established Control Adapters into a new Ektron project.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When the Ektron workarea controls were ‘adapted’ (in this case a checkbox) it broke some supporting JQuery statements.&amp;nbsp; So the quandary I found my self in was, so I amend the workarea code to add the control attribute to ‘opt-out’ of using the adapter, or modify the control adapters (and all of their dependent projects) to use an ‘opt-in’ attribute instead?</description>

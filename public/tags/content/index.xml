      <description>Craig’s pointed out an interesting discussion about managing client expectations (that kicked off from a very preachy design article) around the final display of a website across browsers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This sort of discussion has been around for a while now and I think clients are starting to wise up to browser display issues.
Personally, I’m fairly indifferent about how most websites look provided they behave as I expect don’t actively get in my way.</description>

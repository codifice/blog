      <description>It’s on!&amp;nbsp; I’ve got 8 days to overhaul the Volkswagen Type 2 Owners Club (www.vwt2oc.com) before work beckons again….&amp;nbsp; A month ago I decided to rebuild the existing website using n2cms.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, in that time when I was going to research best practise and get some test sites working….I’ve done nothing.&amp;nbsp; So, I’ve decided to incentivise myself by blogging my progress….
My Basic Plan of Action is:
 Day 1 – Project Setup  SVN Configuration  Create Build Script to compile N2CMS for project  Integrate Forum Add On with n2cms    Day 2 – N2CMS Configuration  Integrate the Membership Provider from n2cms/forum/legacy vwt2oc  Construct basic site structure (homepage/articles/forum/gallery/events calendar/etc)  Create VWT2OC basic theme    Day 3 – VWT2OC Membership Model  Implement Club Member/Membership Data Model in n2cms  Basic Admin Screens for Members  Initial member import routine from current site    Day 4 – My Account and Personalization  Improve member import routine  Membership Reports/Maintenance from with N2CMS  Initial ‘My Account’ page for front end    Day 5 – End User Approval/eCommerce  Deploy to temporary hosted location for client approval of WIP  Import Membership Purchasing Mechanism for legacy app  Integrate NoChex/Paypal payment gateways    Day 6 – Review of Progress  Review functionality and prioritise urgent issues with work so far    Day 7 + 8 – Getting a functional site   Ha!</description>

      <description>Many moons ago (~3 years) I did a bit of family rate development to create a simple website for the Volkswagen Type 2 Owners Club – www.vwt2oc.com.&amp;nbsp; The brief was fairly sparse on detail, they needed a website to manage their memberships and take orders online, a few content manages pages and a basic forum to take over from their previous mainly static site that was looking a little long in the tooth.</description>

      <description>This is tricky because tfs2svn stopped being updated when subversion 1.4 ruled the roost.&amp;nbsp; Here are the steps that I took:
 Have a subversion repository ready to receive the project (including ‘pre-revprop-change’ hook – mine is a simple ‘exit 0’ batch file) Install TortoiseSVN 1.6 Download Collabnets command line client for svn 1.6 (svn-win32-1.6.15.zip) Install tfs2svn 1.1 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tfs2svn/files/tfs2svn/1.1/tfs2svn.setup.msi/download) on my development VM Extract the svn-win32 command line client and copy the contents of ‘bin’ folder over the contents in ‘C:\Program Files (x86)\Kevin Colyar\tfs2svn\libs\svn-win32-1.</description>

      <description>Well, Webhost4Life have yet to restore the current site so I can’t work through the develop model/import data/rinse/repeat iterations which I’ll need to ensure a clean migration at the end of the project.&amp;nbsp; Still at least they’re keeping me updated…and not at all keeping me in the dark with vague promised that someone&#39;s working on it.&amp;nbsp; Bastards.
I guess it’s my fault for trusting them to do all the database backups (like they’re paid to do)….</description>

      <description>It’s on!&amp;nbsp; I’ve got 8 days to overhaul the Volkswagen Type 2 Owners Club (www.vwt2oc.com) before work beckons again….&amp;nbsp; A month ago I decided to rebuild the existing website using n2cms.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, in that time when I was going to research best practise and get some test sites working….I’ve done nothing.&amp;nbsp; So, I’ve decided to incentivise myself by blogging my progress….
My Basic Plan of Action is:
 Day 1 – Project Setup  SVN Configuration  Create Build Script to compile N2CMS for project  Integrate Forum Add On with n2cms    Day 2 – N2CMS Configuration  Integrate the Membership Provider from n2cms/forum/legacy vwt2oc  Construct basic site structure (homepage/articles/forum/gallery/events calendar/etc)  Create VWT2OC basic theme    Day 3 – VWT2OC Membership Model  Implement Club Member/Membership Data Model in n2cms  Basic Admin Screens for Members  Initial member import routine from current site    Day 4 – My Account and Personalization  Improve member import routine  Membership Reports/Maintenance from with N2CMS  Initial ‘My Account’ page for front end    Day 5 – End User Approval/eCommerce  Deploy to temporary hosted location for client approval of WIP  Import Membership Purchasing Mechanism for legacy app  Integrate NoChex/Paypal payment gateways    Day 6 – Review of Progress  Review functionality and prioritise urgent issues with work so far    Day 7 + 8 – Getting a functional site   Ha!</description>

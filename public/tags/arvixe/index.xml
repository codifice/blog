      <description>My webhosting company (arvixe) recently suspended my account due to a flood of ‘Inbox Full’ emails being sent to a mail forwarding alias (which then forwarded to the same accounts, which were full – D’Oh!).&amp;nbsp; After a bit of investigation it turns out some kind soul has been spoofing emails from that account.
Apparently, there’s a nice little DNS entry that you can add so that email servers can validate that the emails have only been sent from recognised servers.</description>

      <description>My WebHost4Life Trials are over.&amp;nbsp; I was finally let in to a secret cabal of WH4L users who know the secret truth behind the ‘migration’ myth….the old control panel still exists!&amp;nbsp; Yay!&amp;nbsp; It only took a week of chasing support staff daily.&amp;nbsp; So, now I’ve got control of the database, DNS records, etc, etc.&amp;nbsp; VWT2OC has moved to it’s new home with Arvixe.&amp;nbsp; The page load for the n2cms build has dropped from ~15s to ~4s from an empty cache and the first request time for a freshly recycled app pool is ~10 seconds – not a minute!</description>

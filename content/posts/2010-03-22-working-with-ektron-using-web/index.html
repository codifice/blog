---<h2></h2>  <p>Like a lot of enterprise CMS production <a title="The ektron homepage" href="http://bit.ly/d0YHh7" target="_blank">Ektron</a> expects you to work in a particular way and provides lots of help for non-developers to quickly produce websites with minimal technical skills.&nbsp; But what if you have more technical needs?</p>  <p>One of the downsides (in my opinion) of developing websites against Ektron, is the expectation that you will be integrating your code into the existing workarea Web Site Project.&nbsp; </p>  <p>Now, there are <a title="Comparison between Web Site Projects and Web Application Projects" href="http://bit.ly/94cCBc" target="_blank">pros and cons</a> on Web Site over Web Application projects but the big disadvantage for me is the sheer size of the workarea brings Visual Studio to a crawl when your editing code.&nbsp; This is (partly) because of the background compilation that happens in the background to support IntelliSense.</p>  <p>There’s also some Best Practise issues:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Code Standards</strong>:&nbsp; By ‘inheriting’ all of the 3rd Party code into your code base you’ve also limited your ability to ensure that <strong><em>your</em></strong> code works properly.&nbsp; Static Analysis rules. </li>    <li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>: Does your front end code need live in the same project as the administration screen? </li>    <li><strong>Clean Builds</strong>:&nbsp; Unfortunately, the workarea doesn’t build cleanly – there are compilation warnings, these will show up on any build metric reports….not good.&nbsp; Of course, you can fix the warnings but then you’ll need to maintain the fixes with every release. </li>    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> You may only have a three template website, but with an integrated workarea IIS still has to load all of the work area dependencies this takes time…and memory. </li>    <li><strong>Security</strong>: By integrating into the 3rd Party code you’ve increased the <a title="Best Practise Security Coding Principles" href="http://bit.ly/bQa5v5" target="_blank">Surface Area</a> for attackers.&nbsp; If you’re public facing website isn’t properly secured there are several <a title="Google Hack to Expose Unsecured Workareas" href="http://bit.ly/9nEBrE" target="_blank">Google</a> <a title="Google Hack to find LinkIt pages" href="http://bit.ly/c1fSvk" target="_blank">queries</a> that you can be run by hackers to find your site (and even the deployed <a title="Google Hack to Resolve Ektron Versions" href="http://bit.ly/d0YS4U" target="_blank">version</a>). <em>(You can stop this by properly configuring your robots.txt – it won’t make your website bullet proof, but it will be harder for hackers/bots to find you!&nbsp; <u>And change your default admin account!</u>)</em> </li> </ul>  <p>So to my mind, there are three ways of developing against Ektron:</p>  <ol>   <li><strong>Work within the workarea website</strong>:&nbsp; If your working on a small site, don’t currently apply any best practise processes in your build process (<em>or you may have a monster development PC</em>).&nbsp; You’ll be able to leverage all of the built in Ektron functionality with minimal work. </li>    <li><strong>Build your Website in a WAP and deploy to workarea website</strong>:&nbsp; Keeps your code tidy and separate.&nbsp; Good for running static analysis tools, etc.&nbsp; It’s faster to develop (less VS overhead) and you can still use all of the Ektron functionality. </li>    <li><strong>Build your website in a WAP and deploy to a separate location (no workarea)</strong>:&nbsp; Disregard the provided controls and use the provided Ektron API as a repository.&nbsp; Takes more development effort but gives you total control over the performance/security of the website. </li> </ol>  <p>In my next few posts, I’ll be covering how to achieve solutions 2. and 3. and what compromises you’ll need to make along the way…</p>  <ul>   <li><a title="Part 2 of the Article" href="http://bit.ly/cntsnJ" target="_blank">Part 2</a> describes the folder structure and project configuration that you’ll need </li> </ul>

<p><em>My WebHost4Life Trials are over.&nbsp; I was finally let in to a secret cabal of WH4L users who know the secret truth behind the ‘migration’ myth….the old control panel still exists!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; It only took a week of chasing support staff daily.</em>&nbsp; </p>  <p>So, now I’ve got control of the database, DNS records, etc, etc.&nbsp; VWT2OC has moved to it’s new home with Arvixe.&nbsp; The page load for the <a title="N2 CMS" href="http://bit.ly/aco4m4" target="_blank">n2cms</a> build has dropped from ~15s to ~4s from an empty cache and the first request time for a freshly recycled app pool is ~10 seconds – not a minute!</p>  <p>Now all I need is another week off work so I can actually get the website integration done.</p>
